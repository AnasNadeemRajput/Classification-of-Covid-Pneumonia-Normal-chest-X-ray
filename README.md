Classification of Covid, Pneumonia, and Normal Chest X-ray Images
This project aims to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: Covid, Pneumonia, and Normal, using pretrained deep learning models VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. This classification helps in identifying and diagnosing these critical conditions based on medical imaging.

Dataset
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images collected from various sources, including Covid-19 positive cases, pneumonia cases, and normal healthy individuals. The dataset is organized into training, validation, and test sets.

Training Data: Used for training the models.
Validation Data: Used for tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the models during training.
Test Data: Used to assess the final performance of the trained models.
Models Used
VGG16
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network architecture that was proposed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman of the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. It has been widely used for image classification tasks.

ResNet50
ResNet50 is a variant of ResNet (Residual Network) architecture developed by Kaiming He et al. It is known for its deep structure and ability to handle more complex datasets.

InceptionV3
InceptionV3 is another convolutional neural network architecture developed by Google. It is designed to be computationally efficient while maintaining high accuracy.


Use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train each model on the dataset.

Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained models on the test set to measure their performance metrics such as accuracy, loss

Inference:
Use the trained models to classify new chest X-ray images into Covid, Pneumonia, or Normal categories.

Results
Include a summary of the performance metrics achieved by each model on the test set.

Future Work
Discuss potential improvements or extensions to the project, such as exploring other deep learning architectures, augmenting the dataset, or deploying the model for real-time classification.
